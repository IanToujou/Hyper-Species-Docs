# Species

HyperSpecies currently features 9 different species. The species are divided into two categories: Animal-Like and Human-Like.

<chapter title="Demon"/>

<img src="demon_icon.png" alt="demon_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Demon Icon"/> Demons can live almost everywhere on land, but they prefer to hide under the ground. They build huge fortresses to intimidate their foes. Demons are generally seen as evil and bad individuals.

Selecting the Demon class will grant you a variety of active abilities. You can find more details later on in the <a href="Elements.md"/> section.

The passive abilities, buffs and debuffs, are listed in the table below.

<chapter title="Elf"/>

<img src="elf_icon.png" alt="elf_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Elf Icon"/> Elves live deep within the woods. They are specialized on support and healing abilities, and they are a species with many secrets. Because of that, they tend to hide from other species, especially humans.

<chapter title="Reptile"/>

<img src="reptile_icon.png" alt="elf_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Reptile Icon"/> Reptiles are commonly found near water or in the desert, depending on the subclass. They are agile and very specialized on their environment. Reptiles rest in caves, but they need the sunlight to gain energy.

<chapter title="Angel"/>

<img src="angel_icon.png" alt="angel_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Angel Icon"/> Angels are the opposite of demons. They are associated with being good and helping other species, or at least people who worship them. Some angels though, are corrupted, despite their good nature.

<chapter title="Human"/>

<img src="human_icon.png" alt="human_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Human Icon"/> Humans are boring, you say? Humanity has come a long way, building cities, developing technologies and going to war with other species. They don't have any buffs or debuffs, but their innovative skills and will to fight made them survive.

<chapter title="Aquatilia"/>

<img src="aquatilia_icon.png" alt="aquatilia_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Aquatilia Icon"/> Aquatilia are species that only live under the sea. They go very rarely on land, mostly because they cannot survive on it without certain conditions. Aquatilia are more closed off from other species due to their environment.

<chapter title="Feline"/>

<img src="feline_icon.png" alt="feline_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Feline Icon"/> Felines are known for their agility and ability to overcome obstacles. Felines live within their group, and it’s rare to see one with other species. They are not alone most of the time and fight together.
